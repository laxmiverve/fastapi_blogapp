When you need to send data from a client (let's say, a browser) to your API, you send it as a request body.

The response body is the actual content sent back to the client as part of the HTTP response.

A foreign key (FK) is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that links to a column in another table.
Foreign keys link together two or more tables in a relational database.

In this every blog should related to a user so we have create a a relationship between blogs and user 



in FastAPI sqlalchemy models called models
Models are typically used to define the structure of your database tables. They represent how data is stored in your database.
Code: 
class Blog(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'blogs'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    title = Column(String, index=True)
    body = Column(String)
    
    
    
In FastAPI pydantic models are called schemas. 
Schemas are used for data validation and serialization. They define the shape of the data that is sent to and received from the API endpoints.
Code -> class BlogSchema(BaseModel):
    		title: str
    		body: str
    
    
    
Whenever we say response model we talked about the pydantic in simple word talked about the schemas.
Response model is a way to define the structure and data types of the response that an endpoint will return.
